# Continuous Integration training task

This repo was made for demonstrating an automated build flow for EPAM Academy.

It exposes the following grunt tasks:
- uglify: concatenate, minify and compress the JS sources
- processhtml: replace the dev source files to a compiled prod file
- jshint: run jshint on the source files
